Another rendition of the Todo App!
=================

This was a two part assignment. The first part (located in main.js) was to get more practice using _.template. The goal was to use [todomvc.com](http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/) as an example and write out a fully functional todo app. The second part, was an introduction to Backbone (located in hmwk.js) where I started to redo the app using Backbone components.
